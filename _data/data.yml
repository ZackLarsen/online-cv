career-profile:
    title: Career Profile
    summary: |
      After completing a Master's program in predictive analytics, I began 
      working as a data scientist on a clinical team for a large nonprofit 
      health insurer in Chicago. Most of my work in this role has been related
      to causal inference in an observational setting, which presents signficant
      challenges. In order to be as precise as possible in estimating causal
      effects for the disease management and case management programs my team
      evaluates, we have to meet stringent data requirements and carefully
      evaluate the assumptions we make.

      In addition to challenges regarding modeling, evaluation and interpretation,
      the projects my team works on require complete ownership from start to finish
      over data procurement, modeling and the presentation of findings. Many of the
      evaluations that are requested by clinical and operations teams have tight
      deadlines and it is crucial to develop software tools to enhance efficiency and
      promote best practices for organizing and structuring projects to stay focused
      and ensure reproducibility.

education:
    - degree: MSc in Predictive Analytics
      university: DePaul University School of Computing
      time: 2015 - 2017
      details: |
        With a concentration in computational methods, this program helped
        me to develop a strong engineering background to support my other
        coursework in statistical learning, advanced machine learning, and 
        special topics in artificial intelligence. Some of the more advanced
        coursework I completed here were in the following classes:

          - Neural Network and Deep Learning
          - Interactive Data Visualization
          - Natural Language Processing
          - Intelligent Information Retrieval

    - degree: BSc in Finance and Management
      university: Purdue University
      time: 2007 - 2011
      details: |
        Part of the Krannert School of Management, this program encouraged
        a very rigorous quantitative approach to financial management and 
        general business management practices. I took several courses in 
        statistics and linear programming for business and economics that
        developed an interest I would later translate into my Master's
        degree in predictive analytics and my career transition to data science.
